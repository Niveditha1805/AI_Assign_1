1. Robot Path-finding Problem: In a grid, a robot is initially located in a cell and must find 
its way to the goal located in another cell. There may be obstacles in the grid which the 
robot has to avoid. 
Use A* search to solve the robot path-finding problem. Find at least 3 heuristics for A* 
search and compare the performance of the heuristics. 
(You need to first develop the code for creating a grid with random obstacles, random 
starting cell and random goal cell. Then, develop the code for each heuristic in A* search. 
For each heuristic, run the program multiple times with randomly generated grids to get 
the performance of each heuristic. Then create a graph to compare the heuristics. You must 
decide the metrics with which the heuristics can be compared.)



2. Design the timetable generation problem as a constraint satisfaction problem. Solve the 
problem using: 
a. Backtracking with variable-ordering and value-ordering heuristics. 
b. Backtracking with forward checking 
Compare the performance of both the methods using your own metrics.
